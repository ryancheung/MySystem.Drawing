# MySystem.Drawing

This library provide light weight System.Drawing classes including `Color`, `Point`, `PointF`, `Size`, `SizeF`, `Rectangle`, `RectangleF` for game development.

The original `System.Drawing.Color` is too overhead, the runtime size of it shows 24 bytes, it's damn too big for game.

# Installation

`dotnet add package MySystem.Drawing`
